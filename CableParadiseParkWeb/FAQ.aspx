<h1><center>How can you wakeboard without a boat?</center></h1>

<p>An overhead cable pulls riders across the water with a joystick controlled zipline. 
The cable can be set to pull at a slow speed for beginners or a faster speed for advanced riders. 
It replaces the need for a boat, reduces waves while riding, and allows for tricks to be done on features, jumps and rails, 
that could not be found on a lake. It is easier to teach beginners because there is no wasted time turning 
the boat around after a fall and the rope from the cable pulls riders at a sharper upward angle.</p>

<br>
<h1><center>I have never wakeboarded before. How do I start?</center></h1>

<p>Riding behind the cable is easy to learn. Because of the ease of reversing the handle, the rider is able to get a
lot more attempts in a short period of time compared to a boat. The cable has a speed pre-set for beginners. 
CPP offers a learn-to-ride package for $20. this includes a 10 minute private lesson and all rental gear to get you out 
on the water. After the lesson if you purchase additional ride time that same day you can hold onto your rental gear for free.</p>
